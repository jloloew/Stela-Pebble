Stela-Pebble
============

The Stela app for Pebble goes great with the [iOS Stela app](https://github.com/jloloew/Stela-iOS).

Using Stela, you can read articles from around the web quickly and easily, right on your wrist! Just surf to the article on your phone and hit the Stela button and you can start reading instantly from your Pebble smartwatch. You can read in the shower, and you can even turn your phone off to save that last 5% of your battery. Stela uses a simple, clean, and intuitive interface to show the text one word at a time. Not only does this allow you to read comfortably on such a small screen, but it can even help you to read faster. Words are flashed on the screen one at a time, and they are optically centered on the screen. This allows you to spend less time moving your eyes from word to word (called saccades) and more time reading the content.
